# CAIS-Data-Science-Bowl-Demo

**Summary:** Takes in a numpy file containing preprocessed lung scans (each patient has 20 50x50 scan slices), and uses Matplotlib generates
2D lung scan images in real time while training a convolutional neural network in TensorFlow to predict whether or not the patient
has lung cancer.

Created initially for the [2017 Data Science Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017), and adapted into a demo for our AI club at USC ([CAIS++](http://caisplusplus.usc.edu/)).
